<!-- ABOUT ME -->
<h2 id="about-me"> :pencil: About me!</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
Hey there 👋🏼 
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
I'm Giuliano, a 28 year old junior software developer from Scotland. I've spent the last 5 years traveling the world, working with a global leading brand in the aviation industry - and now have made a career change into tech! I'm currently looking for my first role in industry and excited about the opportunity to be involved in something special.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
I've just completed a 16 week intensive bootcamp with CodeClan. During the course I've earned a personal development award in Professional Software Development.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
I've spent over 800 hours hands on coding, and the languages I've learnt include Python, JavaScript, Java & SQL. I've also gained experience with a myriad of frameworks and tools including, but not limited to - React, Express, Flask, MongoDB, Spring, HTML, CSS, React Native & Cypress. 
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
You'll find some of my larger projects in the pinned section on GitHub - I urge you to explore them and have a look at what I've built 😁
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
I have a keen interest in novel & disruptive technologies, always being intrigued about new ideas that can improve the quality of people's lives. If you'd like to have a chat, or have any questions - please reach out to me at giulianoderosas@gmail.com 📫 Thanks for stopping by!
